Portfolinator
=============

This is a Wordpress plugin that extends the built-in Wordpress `[gallery]`
shortcode. It allows you to create a root page where you can put all your
gallery pages under. When the root page is rendered, it will render any content
on the root page and then insert a lightbox gallery of all the pages under it
where there is a `[gallery]` shortcode.

Installation
------------

1. Create your root page for your portfolio. Edit your content for this page
   and place all pages with a `[gallery]` shortcode under this page.

2. [Download the latest official version][dl] of the plugin.

3. Unzip and upload via FTP to your Wordpress installation. Or simply upload
   the ZIP file using Wordpress admin.

4. Configure the plugin. Go to Settings/Portfolinator. Save your settings.
